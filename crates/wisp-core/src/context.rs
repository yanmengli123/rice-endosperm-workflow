//!
//! `/compact` (`ContextManager::compact`) first archives the full history to a

//! read/grep it to retrieve anything folded away — then:
//! 1. safely prune old tool output, reasoning, and images without deleting
//!    user or visible assistant text;
//! 2. bound a still-oversized recent tool result;
//! 3. if semantic turns must be removed, summarize a sanitized projection of
//!    the original history and install one checkpoint plus a token-budgeted
//!    recent tail. A later compaction explicitly updates that checkpoint.
