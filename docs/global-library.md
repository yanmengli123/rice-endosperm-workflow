# Global Library

The Library keeps immutable copies of code cells and image artifacts across all
projects in the local Wisp installation.

- Click the SVG star beside a Notebook cell to save its language and source.
- Click the SVG star in an image artifact header to save the image bytes and,
  when provenance exists, the code that generated it.
- In an image artifact viewer, open **Code** and use **Copy code** to copy the
  exact recorded source, or the pencil to edit it and drop a re-run request into
  the composer. The recorded source in `execution_log` is never rewritten.
- Open **Library** from the Projects screen or a project sidebar. Items can be
  searched, filtered, removed, or traced back to their source project/session.

The global Library list transfers bounded code previews rather than every saved
source blob. Searches still cover the complete stored source in SQLite, while
Notebook and Highlights load full source only for the active session.

A saved item's code is versioned: the starred snapshot is the immutable v1, and
each edit appends a new version (`library_item_versions`) instead of rewriting
it. This applies to `code` items and to a figure's generating code; text
excerpts stay verbatim because they anchor highlights back to the transcript.
From a project (not the Projects screen), **Insert into chat** pre-fills the
composer with the selected version — the request names the item id and version
number, and the user still sends it.

Library data lives in `library.sqlite` beside the main `wisp.sqlite` app
database. Project and session IDs/names are stored as source snapshots without
cross-database foreign keys. Deleting the source project, session, or workspace
therefore does not delete or alter a saved Library item; the source link may no
longer open, but the saved code/image remains available.

The first version accepts code up to 2 MiB and PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, or BMP
images up to 32 MiB. PDFs and arbitrary workspace files are not Library items.
