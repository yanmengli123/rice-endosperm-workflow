# Model configuration

In General settings, **Suggest follow-up questions** is enabled by default.
After a completed reply, Wisp uses that conversation's current model to offer
three optional next questions. That secondary call reads only the four most
recent user turns, so completing a long, tool-heavy conversation does not load
and duplicate its full history. The suggestion panel can be hidden per reply,
or the setting can be turned off to skip the extra model call entirely. Wisp
does not request suggestions for failed, cancelled, paused, or tool-only turns;
the current turn must contain a visible final answer.

The desktop transcript also treats ordinary tool output as a preview: tool
results are limited to 4,000 characters and streamed terminal output to 64 KiB
(with carriage-return progress updates folded in place). Complete answer, plan,
and question cards are not clipped. The durable model transcript is unchanged;
these limits apply to the WebView presentation and its replay data.

Long conversations use the same bounded tail whether they stay open or are
reopened. After a live transcript grows past 40 completed user turns, the
WebView unloads older reactive rows and keeps the latest 20; **Load earlier
messages** restores the durable history from SQLite. This presentation limit
does not change model context, exports, artifacts, or the saved transcript.

wisp-science calls remote LLM APIs through model profiles. Desktop users
configure these in **Settings -> Models**. **Add API access** is bring-your-own-key:
enter the shared **Base URL** and API key first, then add every chat and image
model that key can call. Each model row independently selects its **Protocol**,
model ID, optional endpoint suffix, display name, and capabilities. Models
created in one **Add API access** form share that form's Base URL and key, even
when their protocols or endpoint suffixes differ. Leave the key blank to reuse
a key already stored for that Base URL. Paste a different key to keep the new
models on a separate credential — the same host can have several keys, each
with its own model batch. Use distinct **display names** when two batches use
the same model IDs. Changing a stored key on one profile updates other profiles
that currently share that same key and Base URL; it does not overwrite a
different key on the same host.
A models.dev catalog baked in at build time maps exact model IDs to the
vendor's documented ceilings: for a catalog-known model the form auto-fills
**Max output tokens** and **Context window** and shows the ceiling next to the
inputs. Saving a max-output value above the documented ceiling is rejected with
an inline error instead of failing mid-turn with a provider 400, and a context
window above the ceiling is clamped down on save. Models absent from the
catalog keep manually entered values.

The composer model picker binds the selected HTTP model to the current
conversation. Switching one populated conversation asks for confirmation and
does not change any other conversation. Empty conversations switch immediately
without a warning. The active profile in Settings remains the default for new
conversations. Hovering a model row in the picker overlays the reasoning effort
inside the model information area without reserving a separate column, and
reveals its **Edit** button. The button opens a flyout to the right of the model
menu listing the effort levels the model family is documented to support (same
curated list as the model form in Settings).
Choosing a level saves it as the profile's default — it applies to every
conversation using that model and is not scoped to the current conversation.
Choosing "default" clears the value so the provider decides.

OpenAI Chat Completions and Responses profiles also have a **Fast mode** toggle
on the model form, next to reasoning effort. Off uses the provider default and
omits the field; on sends top-level `service_tier: "priority"` on ordinary
turns, tool calls, retries, and continue-generation. It is independent of
reasoning effort and may increase quota usage. The model toggle is the default
for new conversations. A lightning button beside the composer model picker
shows the effective state and stores an independent per-conversation override;
turning it back to the profile default clears that override. The button is
disabled during a running turn and hidden for unsupported providers and ACP
Agents. ACP Fast Mode remains a separate Agent session configuration.

The built-in Reader used by `#` session references inherits that profile's
model and reasoning effort, but the first retrieval pass is capped at 2048
output tokens. If hidden reasoning fills that budget, or the JSON lands in a
thinking field instead of visible content, Reader retries once with the
profile's full output budget and parses JSON from either field. If structured
retrieval still fails, the cited transcript is injected in truncated form so
the main turn can still use the reference.

Model profiles describe model access and capabilities for the **built-in Wisp
agent**. External coding agents (Codex / Claude via ACP) are configured under
**Settings → Models → ACP Agents** — see [ACP Agents](acp-agents.md). Do not put
an ACP launch command in an HTTP model profile.

For image workflows, mark an API profile as **Supports image input** and
optionally **Use for image analysis**. Image attachments are sent directly to a
visual input model. When the input model is non-visual, Wisp first calls the
assigned vision model and passes its text observations to the input model.
`view_image` and image reads use the assigned vision model in the same way.
Raster image input supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP. Files up to 5 MiB are
sent unchanged. For larger files, Wisp pauses before the model request and asks
whether to create a temporary JPEG input copy with a longest edge of 2048
pixels. The project file is never modified, and the confirmation warns that
fine details may be lost. Source images above 50 MiB remain rejected.

When switching a populated conversation to a non-visual model, the confirmation
explains that previously sent images will be omitted from future requests to
that model. This substitution happens only while preparing the API request; it
does not delete or rewrite the saved conversation. A new image attached after
the switch is analyzed through the assigned vision model. Without an assigned
vision model, Wisp rejects that new image before starting the main model turn.

Image generation is a separate model role. Create an OpenAI-compatible profile
with model ID `gpt-image-2` or `grok-imagine-image-2.0`, then enable **Use for
image generation**. The edit form for those models hides chat-only fields
(max output tokens, context window, reasoning effort, and vision) and shows
image defaults instead: size and quality for `gpt-image-2`, or aspect ratio,
resolution, and quality for `grok-imagine-image-2.0`. `generate_image` uses
those defaults when a request does not specify size or quality. For xAI, use
Base URL `https://api.x.ai` and the OpenAI Chat Completions protocol. The built-in **Scientific Illustrator** calls the
provider's Image API (`/images/generations`) and saves a PNG under `figures/`
when that role is assigned and PNG or image-model generation is requested. An
explicit SVG/vector/editable request always uses the specialist's direct-SVG
path, even when an image model is configured: it writes SVG, renders that
exact SVG to a PNG preview, inspects the preview, and iterates on the SVG.
An explicit PNG request requires the configured image-generation model; it is
not silently replaced with SVG. The configured generation tool is also
available in ordinary built-in-agent
conversations, so a direct request for the Scientific Illustrator, `gpt-image-2`,
or `grok-imagine-image-2.0` can generate the image without preselecting the
specialist. While the request runs, the conversation shows an image placeholder
and replaces it with the generated PNG. When the user does not specify a
format, the specialist uses the assigned image-generation profile to create
PNG if present. Otherwise it uses the same SVG -> PNG preview -> SVG
correction workflow and delivers SVG under `figures/`. Image-only profiles do
not appear in chat, Reviewer, specialist, delegation, or side-chat model
pickers.

An image-generation assignment does not also provide image analysis.
These image models may consume an input image for editing, but their Image API
returns generated pixels rather than the textual observations required by
`view_image` and a non-visual chat model. Configure a chat/Responses profile
with **Supports image input** and **Use for image analysis** for that role; it
may use the same provider credentials, but it remains a separate API
capability.

The **Validate** action checks image-model access through the provider's model
metadata endpoint. If a compatible gateway does not implement the single-model
route and returns `404` or `405`, Wisp checks its model-list endpoint instead.
It does not send the image-only model to Responses/Chat Completions and does not
generate a billable validation image.

Video generation is another separate model role. Create an OpenAI-compatible
profile with model ID `grok-imagine-video`, `grok-imagine-video-1.5`, or
`grok-imagine-video-1.5-preview`, then enable **Use for video generation**.
The edit form shows video defaults instead of chat-only fields: duration
(1–15 seconds, default 5), aspect ratio (`16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4`,
default `16:9`), and resolution (`480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, default `720p`).
A call without overrides uses those profile defaults.

Video generation is asynchronous. The `generate_video` tool submits the job to
the provider's `/v1/videos/generations` endpoint, receives a `request_id`,
then polls `/v1/videos/{request_id}` every 5 seconds (up to 10 minutes) until
the status is `done`, and downloads the temporary `video.url` immediately
before it expires. A `failed` or `expired` status surfaces as a tool error.
Transient `auth_unavailable` / `503` submission failures are retried up to
three times. The finished MP4 is saved under `media/` (for example
`media/clip.mp4`) and the tool result references that path so the final answer
can link to it. Generation usually takes 1–2 minutes. Video-only profiles do
not appear in chat, Reviewer, specialist, delegation, or side-chat model
pickers, and the **Validate** action probes them through the same model
metadata endpoint as image models — no billable video is generated.

## API protocols

| Protocol | Use when | Per-model fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | DeepSeek, GLM, local gateways, or any `/chat/completions` compatible endpoint | Protocol, Model ID, optional endpoint suffix, optional Fast default |
| OpenAI Responses | Reasoning/tool-call models through `/v1/responses` | Protocol, Model ID, optional endpoint suffix, optional Fast default |
| Anthropic | Claude-compatible models through `/v1/messages` | Protocol, Model ID, optional endpoint suffix |

Enter the API root as the shared Base URL. Do not append `/v1`,
`/chat/completions`, `/responses`, or `/v1/messages`; Wisp adds the matching
request path for the selected protocol. If a service exposes one protocol or a
specific image model below a distinct path, put that path in the model's
optional **Endpoint suffix**. Wisp joins the suffix to the Base URL first, then
adds the selected protocol's request path. For OpenAI-compatible services, Wisp
tries both `/chat/completions` and `/v1/chat/completions` when the base URL has
no explicit version or endpoint path. It only falls back when the first route
is missing or returns an obvious non-API response, so authentication and
rate-limit failures are not duplicated.

For example, one DeepSeek API key can be represented by the shared Base URL
`https://api.deepseek.com`. Models using OpenAI Chat Completions or OpenAI
Responses leave the endpoint suffix blank. A model using DeepSeek's Anthropic
entry selects the Anthropic protocol and sets its endpoint suffix to
`/anthropic`, producing the effective Base URL
`https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic` before Wisp adds `/v1/messages`.
To put a second DeepSeek key on the same host, open **Add API access** again,
keep `https://api.deepseek.com`, and paste the other key instead of leaving
it blank.

OpenAI-compatible reasoning streams are normalized into one reasoning channel.
Empty `content` placeholders sent alongside Alibaba/DashScope
`reasoning_content` chunks are ignored, so a continuous thought process remains
one disclosure in the conversation. If a compatible relay resends the full
`content` or `reasoning_content` snapshot on every SSE chunk instead of a
fragment, Wisp keeps only the new suffix so the assembled reply and live UI
events stay linear.

If a provider ends a turn after returning only reasoning tokens—without visible
text or a tool call—Wisp reports a resumable error instead of showing the turn
as silently processed. Completed tool results remain in the conversation; use
**Resume** to request the missing final reply without replaying those tools. If
this repeats in a long conversation, send `/compact` before resuming to fold old
turns while preserving an archive of the full history.

Wisp also treats an SSE `error` payload and a Responses API status other than
`completed` as a failed, resumable turn, even when a compatible relay keeps the
HTTP status at 200 or appends a `[DONE]` marker. Partial output is not committed
as a final answer, completed tool results remain available, and follow-up
questions are not generated for that interrupted turn.

**Settings → Session → Automatically compact long conversations** is enabled by
default. Following mangopi-cli's model-boundary approach, Wisp checks the
estimated context before every native-agent model call, including later calls
after large tool results and ephemeral host/reviewer injections. At 80% it
archives the complete pre-compact history and targets the trigger minus an
adaptive headroom (twice the measured per-iteration growth, at least ~16K
tokens, at most 20% of the window), so slow conversations keep more context
while fast tool loops still land well clear of the next trigger. Older tool
output, reasoning, and images are safely pruned first without shortening user
messages or visible assistant answers — protection is counted in agent rounds
(user messages and tool-call batches), so a single instruction followed by
hundreds of tool calls still leaves old rounds prunable; oversized recent tool
payloads become bounded excerpts that point to the archive. If semantic turns
must be removed, Wisp summarizes a sanitized projection of the original
history before deleting them, then retains one incrementally updated summary
checkpoint plus at most two recent turns in an 8K-token tail. Raw images and
large tool results are not replayed to the summary model. The internal summary
instruction is never added to the conversation, and a failed compaction rolls
back the rewrite and stops before Wisp can send the known-oversized main
request; after such a failure, automatic retries are suppressed until the
estimate grows by another tenth of the window, so a doomed compaction is not
repaid at every model boundary. Tool
results are also capped to a 16 KiB head/tail excerpt when they enter model
context (the full result is still shown in the tool event), preventing one
read, grep, browser, or MCP response from consuming the whole window. Each
automatic or manual rewrite leaves a persistent **Context automatically
compacted** / **Context compacted** flag in the conversation with the before
and after request-token estimates. Turning the setting off keeps the warning,
manual `/compact`, and overflow recovery dialog available. ACP agents are not
modified because their remote transcripts are owned by the ACP process.

After a native-agent reply, the composer footer shows the estimated percentage
of the active model's context window. The limit tracks the model the session
is currently bound to: switching models or editing a profile's context window
re-bases the gauge immediately, without waiting for the next reply. Open it
for a detail card aligned to the
composer width that splits the same calibrated request estimate into system
prompt, built-in tool definitions, rules, selected Skills, MCP and other
dynamic tools, subagent definitions, and conversation content. These buckets
are mutually exclusive and sum to the value used by automatic compaction.
Select any bucket except Conversation to inspect the exact prompt/rule text or
the tool, Skill, MCP, and subagent definitions included in the latest native
request. Conversation remains a size-only category so the usage card does not
duplicate the chat transcript.
Older native usage rows that only stored a total attribute that window to
Conversation until the next reply refreshes the full breakdown. ACP sessions
expose only the total reported by the remote agent, so Wisp labels that value
as an agent-reported total instead of inventing a breakdown it cannot observe.

## Usage dashboard

**Settings → Usage** shows global input, output, reasoning, and cached-token
totals, a 53-week activity chart with **Daily**, **Weekly**, and **Cumulative**
views, an input-plus-output token share by model, and a ranked list of SKILL
(`use_skill`) and MCP (`mcp:*`) tool calls beneath the model chart. Usage is
grouped by project workspace. Open a workspace to inspect its sessions, which
are loaded 20 at a time with Previous/Next pagination; sub-agent rounds remain
folded into their root session.

New usage rounds persist the model and timestamp used for that request. Older
usage events did not contain those fields, so their dashboard model falls back
to the session's saved model binding and their activity date falls back to the
session's latest activity date.

When the provider explicitly rejects a built-in Wisp-agent request for
exceeding its context window, the conversation opens a recovery dialog instead
of leaving the raw error as a dead end. **Compact and continue** archives the
full history, folds older turns, and resumes after the retained tool results.
**Continue in a new conversation** starts a clean session and attaches a
bounded Reader summary of the old conversation as context. **Pause
conversation** preserves the error and completed work without making another
request. Pressing Escape immediately after the dialog opens is equivalent to
pausing; it closes only this recovery surface.

For OpenAI-compatible and Responses API profiles, Wisp sends its internal
`python` REPL tool as `wisp_python` and maps returned calls back to `python`.
This avoids the reserved `python` function-name collision on Codex models,
including when the request is translated by gateways such as CLIProxyAPI.

API keys are stored in the OS keyring. They are not stored in SQLite.

The desktop app stores model profile metadata in `.wisp/wisp.sqlite`. Existing single-model installs are migrated into a `default` model profile the first time settings are loaded.

## Headless CLI

The `wisp-science` headless CLI uses environment variables and supports the
same API protocols:

```powershell
$env:WISP_PROVIDER = "openai"           # openai, openai_responses, or anthropic
$env:WISP_API_URL  = "https://api.deepseek.com"
$env:WISP_MODEL    = "deepseek-v4-flash"
$env:WISP_API_KEY  = "<your provider key>"
cargo run -p wisp-cli
```

The full CLI environment-variable table, eval/RPC commands, and bundled MCP
launch flags are in [development](development.md). Desktop setup, including
ACP agents and remote MCP connections, is in
[basic configuration](basic-configuration.md).
