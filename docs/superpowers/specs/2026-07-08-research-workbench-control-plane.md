# Research Workbench Control Plane

## Goal

Make wisp-science a project-level research workbench rather than a local chat shell with occasional SSH commands. The user should see one research project even when compute happens across local Python, WSL, SSH Linux servers, GPU hosts, SLURM clusters, literature tools, and local figure polishing.

## Core Model

### Project

A research problem and its accumulated state: conversations, decisions, data assets, runs, artifacts, papers, and notes. A project is not identical to one local directory or one remote directory.

### ExecutionContext

A place where commands can execute or tools can be called. Initial context families:

- `local`: current host filesystem and shell.
- `wsl:<distro>`: persistent WSL distribution context on Windows.
- `ssh:<alias>`: host from SSH config or user registry.
- Future: `slurm:<cluster>`, `modal:<workspace>`, `literature:<provider>`, `mcp:<server>`.

Each context should expose capabilities: OS, arch, CPU count, memory if available, GPU summary if available, scheduler if available, conda/mamba/module hints, default workdir, data roots, and whether internet access appears available.

### DataAsset

A data reference. It can be local, WSL, SSH remote, object-store, or external URL. Large omics data should usually be represented as references rather than copied locally. DataAsset records should include role, URI/path, optional checksum, size, origin, and produced_by_run_id when applicable.

### Run

One reproducible unit of work. A Run records the context, command/script/workflow, inputs, environment/probe snapshot, stdout/stderr tails, status, scheduler/job handle, exit code, and produced artifacts.

### Artifact

A consumable output: figure, table, report, model, PDB/mmCIF, notebook, markdown, literature summary, or decision note. Artifacts may live locally or remotely, but the project index should show them uniformly.

## Non-Goals For The First Implementation

- Do not build a full VS Code Remote clone.
- Do not require a daemon on remote hosts in v0.
- Do not sync entire project directories by default.
- Do not require real servers in tests.
- Do not turn every chat message into a graph node; start with explicit decisions/artifacts/runs.

## Current v1 Slice

- Store startup records schema migrations and always registers the `local` execution context.
- `run_in_context` submits a detached Run for `local`, `wsl:<distro>`, or `ssh:<alias>`. Every Run uses a per-Run control directory, an idempotent submission token, a detached timeout-controlled process group (or Windows process tree), persisted process identity, stdout/stderr tails, and a SQLite-owned poller lease. SSH also stages explicit project-relative inputs into an isolated remote `inputs/` directory. Wall timeout is 1s..7d (default 4h) on all contexts. The conversation is not the job lifetime.
- `get_run` reads one persisted lifecycle snapshot. `monitor_run` waits once without additional model calls and renders a live inline Run card whose elapsed time advances every second independently of backend polling; transfer Runs add persisted byte count, throughput, and ETA. `cancel_run` moves work to `cancelling` and records `cancelled` only after the process group (or Windows process tree) confirms termination. Batch SSH/SCP uses `IdentitiesOnly=yes`, and an SSH upload or launch failure stops after its first attempt and requires a manual retry; an unconfirmed persisted start error is failed during recovery without reconnecting. Confirmed handles remain reattachable across app restarts. Authentication, host-key, and handshake failures stop SSH polling immediately while temporary transport failures (`connection reset`, timed out, no route, network unreachable) back off from 5 to 10 to 20 seconds without marking a confirmed Run `lost` or relaunching work; local/WSL pollers use a shorter 1–5s cadence. Legacy foreground local/WSL records without a persisted handle become `lost`, and successfully staged SSH inputs remain persisted.
- SSH submission can stage explicit project-relative files into the remote `inputs/` directory (each staged file is ledgered in `remote_staging`). Workdir-relative `output_specs` globs are collected on the server after success, checksum-verified, pulled back through a persisted transfer Run, and registered locally (`runs.harvested_at`); `bundle: true` packs many-file outputs into one archive artifact, and oversized/remote-residency matches move to the project's persistent remote data area, register as `ssh://` references, and are ledgered as `harvest_persist` so they remain visible and deletable. Exact `ssh://` outputs still register as remote Artifact references without syncing their bytes. Finished workspaces are reclaimed via `cleanup_run_workspace` (guarded by harvested-before-clean), the run-review modal supports selective download/delete, and opt-in per-project retention sweeps expired workspaces. Dropping an SSH host audits remaining External references and ledgered files, then marks those artifact versions `source_discarded`; later download, preview, or transfer of those URIs is refused even if the same alias is re-registered. Scheduler submission and scheduler-aware cancellation remain future work.
- The Contexts UI polls lightweight Run summaries and fetches command/output detail only for a visible monitor or an expanded output panel. It shows remote workdirs, output tails, and poll errors, and exposes cancellation without keeping an agent turn open.
- Each registered context can open independent ephemeral interactive terminals in a resizable, tabbed bottom dock. The `+` menu selects any registered context, including one already used by another live tab. Local, WSL, and system-OpenSSH launch adapters share one PTY-backed TerminalSession manager; xterm instances mount directly in the main webview so Tauri channels never cross iframe boundaries. Hiding the dock keeps live views attached, while explicit termination ends the active process. Terminal buffers are not persisted and tracked computation continues to use Runs.
- Every artifact registration creates an immutable artifact version. Harvested versions point to their producing run; run-to-artifact links are reflected as `produced` research-graph edges. Existing local workspace files can be registered explicitly from the Files context menu without copying or modifying their bytes.
- The `research_graph` agent tool can record data assets, papers, and decisions and add validated project-local edges. The project-wide graph opens from the left sidebar in a dedicated modal with list and graph views; edge metadata appears in the list, SVG tooltips, and a selectable relationship detail panel.

## Milestones

### M1: ExecutionContext v0

Persist contexts, import SSH aliases, detect WSL distros, run capability probes, show contexts to the agent and UI. Remote capability checks share one authenticated SSH session per probe, and an explicitly configured identity file suppresses unrelated ssh-agent identities.

### M2: Run Manager v1

Persist runs/jobs, add status lifecycle, record stdout/stderr/exit status, support cancellation, and harvest declared outputs.

### M3: Workspace Manifest v1

Create and maintain a typed project layout and tool APIs that save/register scripts, data assets, figures, results, reports, literature, and docs into consistent places.

### M4: Research Graph v0

Add linkable nodes and edges for question, decision, data asset, run, artifact, and paper. Use this to answer provenance questions.

## Acceptance Scenario

A user creates one project, registers an omics SSH server and a GPU SSH server, registers data or asks wisp to download data remotely, runs an omics analysis on the omics host, harvests QC reports and result tables, runs a GPU structure analysis on the GPU host using results from the omics run, then creates final figures locally. The project timeline shows all steps as one coherent research history.
