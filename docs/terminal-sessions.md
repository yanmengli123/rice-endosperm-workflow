# Execution-context terminals

Wisp can open an interactive terminal for a registered execution context from
the **Contexts** panel. The terminal opens as a resizable dock below the
conversation and right panel, keeping the active research context visible.

## Context behavior

- `local` starts the user's login shell on macOS/Linux or PowerShell on Windows.
- `wsl:<distro>` starts that distribution with `wsl.exe` and asks WSL to use the
  active project directory. On Windows, **Import WSL** registers the installed
  distributions before opening one.
- `ssh:<alias>` starts the system OpenSSH client with a remote PTY. OpenSSH
  continues to honor SSH config, ssh-agent, ProxyJump, host-key prompts, and
  interactive authentication. When the host is configured for password auth,
  the stored keyring password is supplied through OpenSSH ASKPASS for the
  whole login — the helper files stay on disk until the SSH process exits.

Each **Open terminal** action creates an independent live terminal, including
when another terminal already uses the same context. The dock keeps concurrent
sessions in tabs; use **New terminal (+)** to choose any registered execution
context. Switching tabs keeps every terminal attached so background output is
not interrupted. The **−** button collapses the panel while keeping its views
attached, so shells continue running in the background. The **×** inside each
tab closes that tab and terminates its process. Terminal sessions and scrollback
are ephemeral and are not written to SQLite or included in project sync.

The xterm instances are mounted directly in the main application webview. PTY
attach channels, input, resize events, and terminal rendering therefore share
one Tauri JavaScript context; the dock does not use child iframes or proxy Tauri
IPC across frame boundaries. Hiding the dock keeps each mounted xterm and its
channel alive so tab buffers continue receiving background output.

Interactive terminals are deliberately separate from Runs. Use a terminal for
human-driven exploration, editors, monitors, and debugging. Use the Run Manager
for durable computation that needs lifecycle status, cancellation, output
harvesting, or provenance.

## Current limitations

- SSH sessions do not survive a network disconnect or Wisp restart. A future
  optional tmux integration may provide remote reattachment without making
  tmux a requirement.
- The initial SSH terminal starts in the remote user's home directory because
  project-to-remote workspace bindings are not modeled yet.
- WSL path handling relies on `wsl.exe --cd`; custom automount layouts should be
  verified on the target Windows installation.
- Terminal tabs are not yet persisted across an application restart. They share
  one resizable bottom dock rather than opening separate desktop windows.

## Manual smoke checks

On Windows, verify local PowerShell and an installed WSL distribution can open
in parallel tabs, resize, accept input immediately, run a full-screen
application, switch tabs without losing output, collapse/reopen the dock without
losing the shells, and close a tab to terminate its shell. For SSH, use a test
alias from SSH config and verify host-key/password prompts, resize, `Ctrl+C`,
and disconnect handling.
Automated tests must not require a real WSL distribution or SSH host.
