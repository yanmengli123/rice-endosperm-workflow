# UI design principles

## Icons

- Interactive icons must be SVGs from the shared UI icon renderer or the existing SVG mask set.
- Do not use Unicode characters, emoji, or text glyphs as icons. Their shape, alignment, and availability vary across Windows, macOS, browsers, and fallback fonts.
- Text remains appropriate for labels, status values, scientific notation, and keyboard hints such as `↑↓` or `⌘K`.
- Icon-only controls must retain an accessible `title` or `aria-label`.

## Buttons

- Standalone CTAs use `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost` from `ui/src/styles/base.css`.
- Toolbar rows that already own chrome (modal/settings `.row`, plugin toolbar, plan/approval actions, file retry) use `button.primary` for the filled clay look; do not redefine clay fills per surface.
- Do not use bare `button.primary` for sidebar nav — `.side-btn.primary` is a soft affordance, not a filled CTA.
- Toggle switches use the shared softened clay track and light thumb; keep the full accent fill for primary actions instead of making settings switches visually compete with them.

## Spacing, type, and radius

- Prefer `--space-1`…`--space-7`, `--text-xs`…`--text-display`, and the three radius tiers (`--radius-xs` / `--radius-sm` / `--radius`) from `base.css`.
- Map near-miss radii onto those tiers (6–9→xs, 10–14→sm, 16–22→lg). Keep `999px` pills, `50%` circles, and asymmetric chat bubbles as literals.
- Adopt the scale first on brand surfaces (projects landing, chat empty, research graph); avoid one-off px when extending those surfaces.

## Brand surfaces

- Projects landing keeps a serif hero title with the logo mark and a soft clay wash — not a dashboard of promo cards.
- Chat empty and research-graph empty reuse the logo treatment (`.empty-logo` / `.rp-empty-icon.brand`) instead of dashed placeholders.
- Research graph headings use Source Serif at `--text-lg`; list/canvas stay utilitarian.

## Queued follow-ups

- Follow-ups typed while a turn is running sit in a compact card above the composer, not as dashed transcript bubbles.
- The card shows a count, the parked text, and icon actions. Reorder controls appear only when two or more items are waiting. Cut-in stays a labeled clay pill because it is the distinctive action.
- Icon-only queue controls keep both `title` and `aria-label`.

## Composer attachments and references

- The composer keeps its top-edge resize affordance invisible at rest while preserving the full-width drag target and persisted custom height.
- Context usage sits immediately left of the model picker as a number-free gauge; its needle sweeps from upper-left to upper-right as the active conversation fills its context window.
- The context-usage panel opens docked in the composer column, pushing the transcript up instead of covering it. Dragging the header undocks it into a floating window that stays open while typing; a dock button or double-click returns it. There is no full-screen click-swallowing backdrop.
- Context-usage category rows use semantic elevated, sunken, hover, and accent tokens rather than native button fills, so every light and dark palette keeps the panel visually consistent.
- Files, images, skills, artifacts, conversations, execution environments, and runtime references must remain visually distinguishable before and after send.
- Image attachments use a real thumbnail when the project file is readable. Other files use a document card with a filename and type label.
- Persisted transcript markers such as `Uploaded files:` and `Selected skills:` are transport metadata. The chat UI renders them as cards instead of exposing the raw marker text.
- Saved conversations open at their latest message. After the user scrolls up, deferred content growth and switching between conversations preserve each conversation's visible reading position instead of pulling the viewport toward the middle or resetting to the latest message.
- Long attachment names truncate inside the card; the full value remains available through the control's title.
- Remove controls live inside the related card and retain an accessible label.

## Transcript rendering

- A live assistant message keeps a throttled Markdown prefix plus an immediate, whitespace-preserving plain-text tail. The Markdown budget adapts from 50 ms for short answers to 150 ms above 8,000 bytes and 300 ms above 32,000 bytes; once the turn settles, the remaining tail is rendered once as full Markdown.
- Turn-boundary affordances such as Undo update inside the existing message row; they must not remount or reparse an unchanged historical answer.
- Collapsed activity summaries, tool details, reasoning, and provenance rows do not keep hidden body DOM. Mount the body when its disclosure opens and remove it when the disclosure closes; headers and status remain available while collapsed.
- Transcript-derived Inspector data (artifacts, notebook cells, saved highlights, and the conversation outline) refreshes on structural events and settled revisions rather than on every text delta. Live tool status and provenance headers may update independently through compact keyed projections.

## Topbar and inspector chrome

- The conversation topbar keeps session tabs as the primary signal. Inbox, terminal, and inspector toggles live in `.topbar-actions`.
- Status text appears only when non-empty (or when an API-key action is required) and truncates with a `title` for the full value.
- Specialist labels stay quiet text, not status pills.
- Artifact type badges are neutral mono labels; only tabular data keeps a clay accent. Prefer `--ok` / `--err` / `--clay` over one-off HSL pill colors.

## Responsive workspace layout

- The default 1100 px desktop window keeps the sidebar, conversation, and Inspector as resizable columns. The Inspector becomes a modal drawer only below 960 px, where preserving the conversation width takes priority.
- Scrollable lists keep stable scrollbar gutters and contain overscroll so a nested list does not unexpectedly move the surrounding workspace.

## Dense settings lists

- Long capability lists expose status filters and a visible/enabled count before the rows.
- Secondary editors such as skill tags stay collapsed until requested; the row keeps a short summary so existing metadata remains discoverable.
- Settings that save on interaction say so explicitly, including when changes apply only to new sessions. Empty filter results show an explanatory state instead of a blank list.
