"""mcp-structures-interactions server — structural biology & molecular interactions.

Clean tier-2 schemas over three accuracy-gated fleet packages:

* ``emdb-meta``             — EMDB cryo-EM map *metadata* (entries, Solr search,
                              publication/map/sample/imaging sections, validation metrics)
* ``complexportal-fetch``   — EBI Complex Portal curated complexes (CPX records,
                              participant searches, total-verified pagination)
* ``intact-interactions``   — IntAct binary interaction evidence (complete
                              MI-score-filtered sweeps, interactor details, networks)
* ``pdb-structures``        — RCSB PDB entry/entity/ligand *metadata* (attribute
                              search, capped+flagged against the API total)
* ``alphafold-structures``  — AlphaFold DB prediction metadata (pLDDT summaries,
                              model URLs — payloads never downloaded)

This layer is marshalling only: retrieval, pacing (<=2 req/s per host),
retries and count verification live in the fleet packages.
