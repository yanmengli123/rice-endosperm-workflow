"""Declarative project search and per-accession detail fetch for PRIDE Archive v2.

A search spec is a plain dict::

    {
      "keyword":    "phosphoproteome",          # optional free-text keyword
      "organism":   "Homo sapiens (human)",      # optional, exact facet value
      "instrument": "Orbitrap Eclipse",          # optional, exact facet value
      "disease":    "Covid-19",                  # optional, exact facet value
      "extra_filters": {"experimentTypes": "..."} # optional extra field==value filters
    }

``search_projects`` turns the spec into the upstream ``keyword`` + ``filter``
parameters, then walks ALL result pages (pageSize=100, sorted by accession
ascending so pagination is stable) and returns every hit as a normalized
record, plus the API's own reported total (the ``total_records`` response
header) for verification.
