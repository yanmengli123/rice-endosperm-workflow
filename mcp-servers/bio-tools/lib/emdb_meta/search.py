"""Complete paged EMDB search with hit-count verification.

The EMDB search route (/emdb/api/search/{query}) is Solr-backed but does NOT
expose numFound in its payload (the response is a bare result array / CSV
table with no header object). Two other routes over the same service do expose
query-level counts: /facet/{query}?field=current_status and /yearly/{query}.

IMPORTANT API ASYMMETRY (measured 2026-05-30, documented in the README):
the search route returns released AND obsoleted (status OBS) entries, whereas
the facet and yearly routes count released (REL) entries only. run_search_spec
therefore retrieves every page, splits the rows by current_status, and verifies
the RELEASED row count against the facet-route count (the yearly route is used
as a second, independent formulation by the gate). Obsoleted rows are reported
explicitly, never silently mixed into the released count.
