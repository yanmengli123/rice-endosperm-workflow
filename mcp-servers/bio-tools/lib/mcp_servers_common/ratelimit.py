"""Process-wide per-host request pacing.

The bio aggregate runs every domain server in ONE process, so per-instance
throttles multiply: five independent NCBI-facing clients each pacing at
<=2 req/s sum to ~10 req/s against NCBI's 3 req/s keyless cap (#2875 review).
This module is the shared gate: every client that talks to a shared upstream
host reserves its slot here, keyed by netloc, so the politeness interval is
enforced across the whole process instead of per client instance.

Usage (from a client's transport loop, in place of a local throttle):

    from mcp_servers_common.ratelimit import pace
    pace(url, self.min_interval_s)   # blocks until this process may send

Thread-safe: reservations are serialized under one lock; callers sleep
outside it, so a slow upstream never blocks other hosts' reservations.
