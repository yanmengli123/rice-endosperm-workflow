"""mcp-cancer-models server — cancer cell-line models, CRISPR dependencies,
and cBioPortal tumor-cohort genomics.

Tier-2 domain server (clean schemas; replaces the unshipped
tooluniverse/depmap connector). Retrieval is done by accuracy-gated fleet
packages; this layer is marshalling only:

  * ``depmap-models`` — Sanger Cell Model Passports (CMP) JSON:API;
    SIDM model IDs / SIDG gene IDs. All listings are COMPLETE pagination
    walks, count-verified against the API's own ``meta.count`` (the old
    connector did one request at the default page size with no count check).
  * ``cbioportal-studies`` — cBioPortal public REST API
    (www.cbioportal.org/api, keyless): patient-tumor sequencing studies,
    per-gene mutations / discrete copy-number events, cross-study mutation
    frequency, clinical attribute catalogues. Listings are complete and
    verified against the API's own ``total-count``, or explicitly capped
    with ``truncated`` + the true total — never silently truncated.
