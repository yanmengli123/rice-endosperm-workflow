"""FastMCP server exposing the rfam-families fleet tool.

All retrieval (pacing, retries, content negotiation, deterministic sorting)
lives in the ``rfam-families`` package; this layer is marshalling only.

Known upstream limitations (surfaced honestly, never wrapped or retried):

* ``search_sequence``: Rfam's async cmscan job backend was DOWN at fleet
  build time (2026-06-08) — valid submissions got an HTML 500 "Please come
  back later" while input validation still worked. The fleet raises
  ``SearchUnavailable`` in that case; this server passes the error through.
* ``get_sequence_regions``: upstream 403s this route for very large
  families (e.g. RF00005 with >5M regions) — the error is passed through.
