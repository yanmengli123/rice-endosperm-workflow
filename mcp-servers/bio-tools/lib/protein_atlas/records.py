"""Stable field subset, summary shaping and canonicalization.

The per-gene JSON is a flat dict of ~119 human-readable keys. ~40 of those
are per-cancer prognostics keys ("Cancer prognostics - <cancer>"); the rest
cover identity, expression specificity per compartment, subcellular
location, secretome, antibodies and reliability scores. summarize() groups
the stable subset into sections mirroring the knowledgebase MCP's
tissue/subcellular/pathology/blood/brain + antibody scope.

Canonicalization (documented per contract, implemented once here):
  * JSON with sorted keys, compact separators, UTF-8, ensure_ascii=False
  * lists whose elements are all strings are sorted (unordered collections:
    Uniprot accessions, antibody IDs, location/class/process terms)
  * no scientific content is dropped or rewritten
